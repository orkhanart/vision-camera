## 1-Minute Pitch
The post-photography revolution is here. 26 million artists are using AI tools like MidJourney, Runway, and Stable Diffusion to transform photos into stunning artwork. But there's a problem: the workflow kills creativity.

Right now, artists shoot a photo, transfer it to their computer, upload to an AI platform, wait for processing, download, and iterate. It takes hours and breaks the creative flow. Mobile apps can't help—they don't have the power to run full diffusion models.

VISION changes everything. We've compressed desktop-class diffusion models to run on custom edge hardware. It's the first camera that transforms photos into AI art in real-time—under 2 seconds, completely offline, no computer needed.

Point your camera, select an AI style, shoot, and watch your image become a masterpiece instantly. From impressionist to cyberpunk, watercolor to abstract. Professional quality, portable device, spontaneous creativity.

We're not creating a new market—we're solving real pain for millions of existing AI art users. VISION makes post-photography instant, portable, and accessible anywhere inspiration strikes.
